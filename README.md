# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-with-TensorFlow
This project aims to build a machine learning model using TensorFlow to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28x28 pixels), as seen in the figure below.
